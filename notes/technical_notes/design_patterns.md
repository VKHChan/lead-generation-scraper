# Design Patterns in Practice

## Introduction

This document captures the design patterns used in the project, with practical examples and explanations of why each pattern was chosen. It serves as both a learning resource and a demonstration of pattern implementation in a real-world application.

## Pattern Categories

### 1. Creational Patterns

- Factory Method
- Builder
- Dependency Injection

### 2. Structural Patterns

- Adapter
- Facade
- Composite

### 3. Behavioral Patterns

- Strategy
- Observer
- Command

## Implementation Examples

Each pattern implementation will include:

1. Problem it solves
2. Implementation details
3. Code examples
4. Benefits gained
5. Potential trade-offs

[Examples will be added as patterns are implemented in the project]
