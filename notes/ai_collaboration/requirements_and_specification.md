# Initial Requirements Gathering

We started by creating a high-level requirements document through discussion with an AI agent. The agent helped refine requirements by asking targeted questions across key areas:

### Data Collection

- Target sources and platforms for scraping
- Specific data points to collect
- Industry focus and lead types

### Core Features

- User interface requirements
- Scraping configuration options
- Data management capabilities
- Automation needs

### Technical Requirements

- Scale and performance targets
- Data storage approach
- Integration needs
- Security and compliance

### Operational Needs

- User access model
- Deployment preferences
- Infrastructure requirements

**AI was super helpful** in laying out a clear roadmap for our project requirements. It asked smart questions we might have missed, which was especially great when diving into technical stuff that non-technical folks might find tricky.

**But here's the thing** - we still have to think critically about what the AI suggested:

- Is this feature actually needed, or are we overcomplicating things?
- Does this fit with how we want to build the system?
- Are we keeping our design patterns in mind?
- Can we actually implement this, or is it just fancy talk?

By combining AI's thorough approach with our own common sense, we ended up with requirements that were both complete and actually doable. It's like having a really knowledgeable teammate who throws out lots of ideas, but you still need to pick the ones that make sense for your project.

# Creating user stories

Once we have our high level requirements, we need to create our user stories. Based on the high level requirements created, the AI agent is able to break down into epics and stories for each epic. **However**, once again, this is an iterative approach and in each step, it is important to analyze what the AI agent is suggesting.

When working with AI to create user stories:

1. Provide clear context:

   - Share detailed [`technical design guidelines`](../../docs/technical_design.md)
   - Include [`definition of done`](../../docs/definition_of_done.md) criteria
   - Outline any technical constraints or preferences

2. Review and refine:

   - Validate story complexity and scope
   - Ensure alignment with design patterns
   - Check for technical feasibility
   - Verify business value

3. Maintain consistency:
   - Use standard story format
   - Include acceptance criteria
   - Link to relevant technical documentation
   - Add estimates where appropriate

The use of AI agents significantly accelerates the initial story writing and refinement process, while maintaining quality through careful human oversight and validation. This collaborative approach combines AI's ability to generate comprehensive story breakdowns with the development team's expertise in ensuring practical, well-structured user stories.
