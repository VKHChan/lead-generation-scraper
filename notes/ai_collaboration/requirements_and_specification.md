# Initial Requirements Gathering

We started by creating a high-level requirements document through discussion with an AI agent. The agent helped refine requirements by asking targeted questions across key areas such as:

### Data Collection

- Target sources and platforms for scraping
- Specific data points to collect
- Industry focus and lead types

### Core Features

- User interface requirements
- Scraping configuration options
- Data management capabilities
- Automation needs

### Technical Requirements

- Scale and performance targets
- Data storage approach
- Integration needs
- Security and compliance

### Operational Needs

- User access model
- Deployment preferences
- Infrastructure requirements

**AI was super helpful** in laying out a clear roadmap for our project requirements. It asked questions we might have missed, which was especially great when diving into technical stuff that non-technical folks might find tricky.

**But** we still have to think critically about what the AI suggested:

- Is this feature actually needed, or are we overcomplicating things?
- Does this fit with how we want to build the system?
- Are we keeping our design patterns in mind?
- Can we actually implement this, or is it just fancy talk?

By combining AI's thorough approach with our own common sense, we ended up with requirements that were both complete and actually doable. It's like having a really knowledgeable teammate who throws out lots of ideas, but you still need to pick the ones that make sense for your project.

# Creating user stories

After establishing our high-level requirements, we proceeded with creating user stories. The AI agent effectively helped break down the requirements into epics and individual stories. However, this process required multiple iterations and careful review of the AI's suggestions. Initially, the AI's breakdown of epics wasn't optimally structured, and it overlooked crucial user stories - particularly around information gathering prerequisites before analysis. This oversight likely stemmed from the AI making assumptions about the intended workflow without full context.

When working with AI to create user stories, it is **important**:

1. Provide **detail and clear** context of:

   - [`technical design guidelines`](../../docs/technical_design.md)
   - [`definition of done`](../../docs/definition_of_done.md) criteria
   - Any technical constraints or preferences

2. Review and refine:

   - Validate story complexity and scope
   - Ensure alignment with design patterns
   - Check for technical feasibility
   - Verify business value

3. Maintain consistency:
   - Use standard story format
   - Include acceptance criteria
   - Link to relevant technical documentation
   - Add estimates where appropriate

The use of AI agents **significantly accelerates** the initial story writing and refinement process, however careful human oversight and validation, and technical knowledge is still required to ensure epics and stories quality.
